# Product & Sale Performance Dashboard üõçÔ∏èüì¶

## 1. Project Intro ‚ú®
I created a dashboard project for a company called Ferns N Petals, which focuses on online gifting and flower delivery. This project was built to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends for Ferns N Petals, a gifting and flower delivery brand. The goal was to turn raw data into actionable insights for better business decision-making.

## 2. Tools Used ‚ú®
I used Microsoft Excel with Power Query for data import and cleaning, then built Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
### One challenge was cleaning and merging multiple Excel files from a folder. I solved it using Power Query automation, which made it scalable for future data üîÑ 

## 3. Data Handling Process‚ú®
*  Imported multiple files from a folder using Power Query
*  Cleaned and transformed raw data (e.g., corrected formats, removed duplicates, handled nulls).
*  Structured it into meaningful tables for analysis.
*  Linked tables with PivotTables for dynamic analysis.


## 4. Business Value ‚ú®
* This dashboard enables quick insights into top-performing products, identifies peak revenue months, and highlights products that may require additional marketing or support.
* Top Metrics (KPIs): Total Revenue, Avg Customer Spend, Total Orders, Delivery Time.
* Visuals: ( Revenue by Occasion & Category, Top Cities by Orders, Monthly Sales Trend, Top Products by Revenue, Hourly Revenue Trends)
* I focused on making it clean, easy to use, and visually clear because I know stakeholders want to understand insights quickly, not dig through data.
* For example, marketing teams can see which occasion needs more campaigns or which hours drive more sales and City-wise order distribution for logistic planning.
