# Product & Sale Performance Dashboard ✨

## 1. Intro (Project Overview)
I created a dashboard project for a company called Ferns N Petals, which focuses on online gifting and flower delivery. The goal of this Excel dashboard was to analyze key business performance metrics such as product sales, revenue, and customer trends.

## 2. Tools Used ✨
I used Microsoft Excel (Power Query) to import Folder, clean the data, apply formulas, and create an interactive dashboard using Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting.

## 3. What i Did ✨
* Cleaned raw data and structured it for analysis.
* Built Pivot Tables to summarize revenue and order trends.
* Integrated interactive Slicers for dynamic filtering by Days, months, and product, etc.
* Created visual charts to highlight top-performing products and revenue across categories.
* Applied conditional formatting to highlight critical KPIs, such as underperforming sales or high-performing products, to aid in quick decision-making.

## 4. Business Value ✨
* This dashboard enables quick insights into top-performing products, identifies peak revenue months, and highlights products that may require additional marketing or support.
* I focused on making it clean, easy to use, and visually clear because I know stakeholders want to understand insights quickly, not dig through data.
